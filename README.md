# About
A matrix calculator designed using python. While taking both a linear algebra and python course, I decided that coding a matrix calculator would be an excellent way to combine skills from both classes. 

I recently remade the calculator using React JS. The repository for the updated project can be found [here](https://github.com/Jcssss/MatrixCalculatorWebApp).

The updated project is also live on github pages. You can view the fully functioning calculator [here](https://jcssss.github.io/MatrixCalculatorWebApp/).
