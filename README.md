# Matrix-Calculator
A basic matrix calculator designed using python. While taking both a linear algebra and python course, I decided that coding a matrix calculator would be an excellent way to combine skills from both classes. 

Currently, the only files with any functionality are matrix.py and matrix_calc.py

## matrix_calc.py
The main file where most of the class usage is meant to be written. Adds, subtract and reduces matrices as instructed.

## matrix.py
A class representing an individual matrix with height, width and entries.

## Goals
The hope is to eventually design a cleaner UI, where the user can add input and interact with the calculator.
