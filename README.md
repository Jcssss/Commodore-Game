# Matrix-Calculator
A basic matrix calculator designed using python. While taking both a linear algebra and python course, I decided that coding a matrix calculator would be an excellent way to combine skills from both classes. 

The hope is to eventually design a cleaner UI, where the user can add input and interact with the calculator.
